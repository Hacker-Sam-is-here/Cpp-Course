//similar to importing libs in python
//this contains basic io functions
//c++ doesnt have everything builtin like python, we have to import
#include <iostream>
/*
multiple line comments
*/

//Main Function
int main(){
    //std = standard library
    //cout = console output

    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Its working fine now" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "I am learning C++" << '\n';
    //'\n' = new line, without it it will print on same line
    //endl = end line, without it it will print on same line
    return 0;
    //similar to python return
